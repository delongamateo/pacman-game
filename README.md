Coded this game as hackaton project. It's pac-man game in which map is randomly generatet from API. You can move pac-man on arrow keys,eat apples and bombs.
You can choose size of the map and pac-man has 50% chanse of dying if bomb is eaten.

I learned a lot about JS class, components, fetching APIs, displaying data in DOM and working with JSON files.
